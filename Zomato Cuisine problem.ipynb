      "Foodingsss 5 This is a very nice,big cafe located in the heart of Delhi (cp) I visited this place on Sunday at it was amazing as usual. The live performance was great. The singer was also happy to take song requests. Being in cp... there's always a space restraint,but it wasn't that restricted. Seating was easily available. The staff is very polite and friendly and the food was also good but the pizza we ordered was served too cold and crispy like a papad. But otherwise the place is really cool and nice to chill with family and friends ... especially for the music lovers. The music band and singer was exceptionally talented. Highly recommended üëç\n",
